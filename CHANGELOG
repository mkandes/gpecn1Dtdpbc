CHANGELOG : GPECN1DTDPBC

dev

    * developing some minor improvements to continue to study the Sagnac
      effect as well as the dynamics of an effective one-dimensional 
      Compton generator

2021/04/13 v0.5.7

    + Updated all copyright notices.

2021/04/13 v0.5.6

    + Updated Makefile to support a multi-compiler configuration modeled 
      after the gpse (https://github.com/mkandes/gpse) Makefile.

2021/04/10 v0.5.5

    + Increased the spatial resolution of the default simulation in the
      gpecn1Dtdpbc.sh run script by approximately 5x.

2021/01/03 v0.5.4

    + Updated all gnuplot figures to utilize the output generated by the
      default simulation of the gpecn1Dtdpbc.sh run script.

2021/01/02 v0.5.3

    + Converted README to README.md. Reset default simulation of the
      gpecn1Dtdpbc.sh run script to be one of the example simulations 
      that exhibits 'An Initial Angular Momentum Dependence of the 
      Sagnac Effect for Matter Waves'. Also updated CHANGELOG and 
      removed legacy TESTED sections in the header of the Makefile.

2020/08/03 v0.5.2

    + Added wave_function_switch=2, which allows wavefunc.x to generate
      a pair of Bogoliubov-like plane wave excitations on top of a 
      constant background ground-state solution for a one-dimensional 
      ring.

2017/07/07 v0.5.1

    + minor modifications to the run script gpecn1Dtdpbc.sh; added 
      helper script gs-convert-eps-to-png.sh to convert eps files
      generated by freqtime.gpi and spacetime.gpi to png files; also 
      created TRANSFORM program to study how Doppler effect may impact 
      Sagnac phase shift simulations

2017/04/04 v0.5.0

    + a rebuild of GPECN1DTDPBC from M. C. Kandes, "Sagnac 
      Interferometry with Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Uniformly 
      Rotating Ring Trap", Ph.D. Qualifying Exam, Claremont Graduate 
      University & San Diego State, University (2011).
